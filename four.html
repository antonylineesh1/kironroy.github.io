<h2><center>Four Statements</center></h2>

<h3><center>Cash Flow Statement</center></h3>

<p><strong>Cash flow statement</strong>  is the checkbook of the business.  It covers a period of time vs. a snapshot (balance sheet)

</p>

<p>
    Cash flow covers transactions from <i> operations, financing, and investing  </i>
    Cash is a liquid asset on the Balance Sheet <i>A = L + E</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Liquidity </i> is a termed used to denote whether or not a
    business is generating cash from its assets or convert its assets into cash quickly
</p>

<p>
    Cash is not profit.  Many business' can generate cash but don't make a profit, and profitable business that don't
    generate a whole lot of cash-flow.
</p>

<p><strong> When validating a business, most investors look at the cash-flow statement, rather than the income statement.
    To see if there is a healthy flow of money going into the business
</strong> </p>

<br>

<h3><center>Balance Statement</center></h3>
<p><strong>The Balance Statement</strong>  is a snapshot (instance in time).  It measures the  financial condition of a business
    with respect to its total assets and claims or rights to those assets.  Note the balance statement does not <strong>change over time</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Most important Equation:
    <strong><i> Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong>
</p>

<p>
    Balance sheet insolvency : <strong><i> Assets < Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong>
    Think of a house that you bought for $200k but now is worth $140k.  Even if you sell all your assets you cannot payoff the
    liabilities.
</p>

<p>
    Balance sheet insolvency  is different than <strong> cash flow insolvency</strong>, in that a business may have assets,
    but cannot convert the assets quickly enough to pay bills (Also known as <strong>liquidity</strong>).
</p>

<br>

<h3><center>Income Statement</center></h3>


<p><strong>Income statement </strong> shows booked income and the costs and expenses associated with making that income</p>

<p>Income statement <strong> DOES NOT show cash-flow</strong>.  Cash flow is separate statement.</p>

<p>When validating a business, most investors look at the cash-flow statement, rather than the income statement.
    To see if there is a healthy flow of money going into the business</p>

<br>

<h3><center>Earnings Statement</center></h3>
<p><strong>Retained Earnings Statement</strong> reports accumulated retained earning beginning of the
    year and the addition of any net income that will be added to that retained earnings.</p>

<p>
    <i>Retained Earnings = Previous R.E. + Net Income - Dividends Paid</i>
</p>

<p>
    It also reports and dividends issued to investors.
    Dividends are cash payments made out to shareholders.  Dividends are a type of cash out flow
</p>

<p>
    Three things can be determined by the Earnings statement:
</p>
<p>
    1. Give some or all money (dividends) to investors
    2. Save the money for inside the business
    3. Combination of 1 and 2
</p>

<p>
    Retained earning <strong> does not </strong> report what is done with the retained earnings or cash-flow.
    It just reports the earnings
</p>

<p><strong>1. Customer acquisition cost</strong></p>
<strong>Customer acquisition cost = dollar amount you spend on sales and marketing in order to require a new customer.</strong>
The number indicates efficiency of marketing and is calculated by <i>Total number of customers / Total acquisition costs</i>.
If the company you are looking at is spending too much, consider the options of refining the
marketing strategy and more efficiently allocating the budget.
<p>

</p>
<p><strong>2. Customer retention rate</strong></p>
<p>
    <strong>Customer retention rate = customers who come back regularly for goods and services</strong>
    High retention rates include: <i>High quality product at a competitive price, customer support, and customer satisfaction.</i>
</p>

<p><strong>3. Profit margin</strong></p>

  <p>
      <strong> Profit margin = "markup" how much a product or service's revenue exceeds its cost to the business</strong>
      Business with low margins are vulnerable to drops in sales or poor market share.  This will raise concern about long-term
      sustainability.
  </p>
<p><strong>4. Overhead</strong></p>
<strong> refers to fixed expenses outside labor and production costs. </strong>
Rent, utilities, and insurance are all examples of overhead expenses.
When compared to overall revenue, overhead can indicate a company’s efficiency.
  <p>
 </p>
<p><strong>5. Employee turnover</strong></p>

 <p>
     High employee turnover could be a red flag that current management isn’t engaging staff or rewarding strong
     individual or company performance.
     If you’re considering a business with high turnover, revamp employee policies.

    <p><strong>1. Customer acquisition cost</strong></p><strong>Customer acquisition cost = dollar amount you spend on sales and marketing in order to require a new customer.</strong> The number indicates efficiency of marketing and is calculated by <i>Total number of customers / Total acquisition costs</i>. If the company you are looking at is spending too much, consider the options of refining the marketing strategy and more efficiently allocating the budget.
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>2. Customer retention rate</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Customer retention rate = customers who come back regularly for goods and services</strong> High retention rates include: <i>High quality product at a competitive price, customer support, and customer satisfaction.</i></p>
    <p><strong>3. Profit margin</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Profit margin = "markup" how much a product or service's revenue exceeds its cost to the business.</strong> Business with low margins are vulnerable to drops in sales or poor market share. This will raise concern about long-term sustainability.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Overhead</strong></p><strong>refers to fixed expenses outside labor and production costs.</strong> Rent, utilities, and insurance are all examples of overhead expenses. When compared to overall revenue, overhead can indicate a company’s efficiency.
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>5. Employee turnover</strong></p>
    <p>High employee turnover could be a red flag that current management isn’t engaging staff or rewarding strong individual or company performance. If you’re considering a business with high turnover, revamp employee policies.</p>
